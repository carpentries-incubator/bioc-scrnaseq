## Setup

```{r chunk-opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
library(BiocStyle)
options(digits = 3)
```

Again we'll start by loading the libraries we'll be using:

```{r setup}
library(AUCell)
library(MouseGastrulationData)
library(SingleR)
library(bluster)
library(scater)
library(scran)
library(pheatmap)
library(GSEABase)
```

## Data retrieval

We'll be using the fifth processed sample from the WT chimeric mouse embryo data: 

```{r data, message = FALSE}
sce <- WTChimeraData(samples = 5, type = "processed")

sce
```

To speed up the computations, we take a random subset of 1,000 cells.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

ind <- sample(ncol(sce), 1000)

sce <- sce[,ind]
```

## Preprocessing

The SCE object needs to contain log-normalized expression counts as well as PCA coordinates in the reduced dimensions, so we compute those here: 

```{r preproc, warning = FALSE}
sce <- logNormCounts(sce)

sce <- runPCA(sce)
```

## Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning procedure that is used to
empirically define groups of cells with similar expression profiles. Its
primary purpose is to summarize complex scRNA-seq data into a digestible
format for human interpretation. This allows us to describe population
heterogeneity in terms of discrete labels that are easily understood,
rather than attempting to comprehend the high-dimensional manifold on
which the cells truly reside. After annotation based on marker genes,
the clusters can be treated as proxies for more abstract biological
concepts such as cell types or states.

Graph-based clustering is a flexible and scalable technique for identifying
coherent groups of cells in large scRNA-seq datasets. We first build a graph
where each node is a cell that is connected to its nearest neighbors in the
high-dimensional space. Edges are weighted based on the similarity between the
cells involved, with higher weight given to cells that are more closely related.
We then apply algorithms to identify "communities" of cells that are more
connected to cells in the same community than they are to cells of different
communities. Each community represents a cluster that we can use for downstream
interpretation.

Here, we use the `clusterCells()` function from the
[scran](https://bioconductor.org/packages/scran) package to perform
graph-based clustering using the [Louvain
algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/P10008) for
community detection. All calculations are performed using the top PCs to
take advantage of data compression and denoising. This function returns
a vector containing cluster assignments for each cell in our
`SingleCellExperiment` object. We use the `colLabels()` function to assign the
cluster labels as a factor in the column data.

```{r cluster}
colLabels(sce) <- clusterCells(sce, use.dimred = "PCA",
                               BLUSPARAM = NNGraphParam(cluster.fun = "louvain"))

table(colLabels(sce))
```
You can see we ended up with `r length(table(colLabels(sce)))` clusters of varying sizes.

We can now overlay the cluster labels as color on a UMAP plot:

```{r cluster-viz}
sce <- runUMAP(sce, dimred = "PCA")

plotReducedDim(sce, "UMAP", color_by = "label")
```

:::: challenge

Our clusters look semi-reasonable, but what if we wanted to make them less granular? Look at the help documentation for `?clusterCells` and `?NNGraphParam` to find out what we'd need to change to get fewer, larger clusters.

::: solution

We see in the help documentation for `?clusterCells` that all of the clustering algorithm details are handled through the `BLUSPARAM` argument, which needs to provide a `BlusterParam` object (of which `NNGraphParam` is a sub-class). Each type of clustering algorithm will have some sort of hyper-parameter that controls the granularity of the output clusters. Looking at `?NNGraphParam` specifically, we see an argument called `k` which is described as "An integer scalar specifying the number of nearest neighbors to consider during graph construction." If the clustering process has to connect larger sets of neighbors, the graph will tend to be cut into larger groups, resulting in less granular clusters. Try the two code blocks above once more with `k = 30`. Given their visual differences, do you think one set of clusters is "right" and the other is "wrong"?

```{r}
sce$clust2 <- clusterCells(sce, use.dimred = "PCA",
                           BLUSPARAM = NNGraphParam(cluster.fun = "louvain",
                                                    k = 30))

plotReducedDim(sce, "UMAP", color_by = "clust2")
```

## Marker gene detection

To interpret clustering results as obtained in the previous section, we
identify the genes that drive separation between clusters. These marker
genes allow us to assign biological meaning to each cluster based on
their functional annotation. In the simplest case, we have *a priori*
knowledge of the marker genes associated with particular cell types,
allowing us to treat the clustering as a proxy for cell type identity.

The most straightforward approach to marker gene detection involves
testing for differential expression between clusters. If a gene is
strongly DE between clusters, it is likely to have driven the separation
of cells in the clustering algorithm.

Here, we use `scoreMarkers()` to perform pairwise comparisons of gene
expression, focusing on up-regulated (positive) markers in one cluster when
compared to another cluster.

```{r marker-detect}
rownames(sce) <- rowData(sce)$SYMBOL

markers <- scoreMarkers(sce)

markers
```

The resulting object contains a sorted marker gene list for each
cluster, in which the top genes are those that contribute the most to
the separation of that cluster from all other clusters.

Here, we inspect the ranked marker gene list for the first cluster.

```{r marker-clust1}
markers[[1]]
```

Each column contains summary statistics for each gene in the given cluster.
These are usually the mean/median/min/max of statistics like Cohen's *d* and AUC
when comparing this cluster (cluster 1 in this case) to all other clusters.
`mean.AUC` is usually the most important to check. AUC is the probability that a
randomly selected cell in cluster *A* has a greater expression of gene
*X* than a randomly selected cell in cluster *B*. You can set `full.stats=TRUE` if you'd like the marker data frames to retain list columns containing each statistic for each pairwise comparison.

We can then inspect the top marker genes for the first cluster using the
`plotExpression` function from the
[scater](https://bioconductor.org/packages/scater) package.

```{r plot-markers, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
c1_markers <- markers[[1]]

ord <- order(c1_markers$mean.AUC, 
             decreasing = TRUE)

top.markers <- head(rownames(c1_markers[ord,]))

plotExpression(sce, 
               features = top.markers, 
               x        = "label", 
               color_by = "label")
```

Clearly, not every marker gene distinguishes cluster 1 from every other cluster. However, with a combination of multiple marker genes it's possible to clearly identify gene patterns that are unique to cluster 1. It's sort of like the 20 questions game - with answers to the right questions about a cell (e.g. "Do you highly express Ptn?"), you can clearly identify what cluster it falls in.

:::: challenge

Looking at the last plot, what clusters are most difficult to distinguish from cluster 1? Now re-run the UMAP plot from the previous section. Do the difficult-to-distinguish clusters make sense?

::: solution

You can see that at least among the top markers, cluster 6 (pale green) tends to have the least separation from cluster 1. 

```{r}
plotReducedDim(sce, "UMAP", color_by = "label")
```

Looking at the UMAP again, we can see that the marker gene overlap of clusters 1 and 6 makes sense. They're right next to each other on the UMAP. They're probably closely related cell types, and a less granular clustering would probably lump them together.

## Cell type annotation

The most challenging task in scRNA-seq data analysis is arguably the
interpretation of the results. Obtaining clusters of cells is fairly
straightforward, but it is more difficult to determine what biological
state is represented by each of those clusters. Doing so requires us to
bridge the gap between the current dataset and prior biological
knowledge, and the latter is not always available in a consistent and
quantitative manner. Indeed, even the concept of a "cell type" is [not
clearly defined](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2017.03.006), with most
practitioners possessing a "I'll know it when I see it" intuition that
is not amenable to computational analysis. As such, interpretation of
scRNA-seq data is often manual and a common bottleneck in the analysis
workflow.

To expedite this step, we can use various computational approaches that
exploit prior information to assign meaning to an uncharacterized
scRNA-seq dataset. The most obvious sources of prior information are the
curated gene sets associated with particular biological processes, e.g.,
from the Gene Ontology (GO) or the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) collections. Alternatively, we can directly compare our
expression profiles to published reference datasets where each sample or
cell has already been annotated with its putative biological state by
domain experts. Here, we will demonstrate both approaches on the
wild-type chimera dataset.

### Assigning cell labels from reference data

A conceptually straightforward annotation approach is to compare the
single-cell expression profiles with previously annotated reference
datasets. Labels can then be assigned to each cell in our
uncharacterized test dataset based on the most similar reference
sample(s), for some definition of "similar". This is a standard
classification challenge that can be tackled by standard machine
learning techniques such as random forests and support vector machines.
Any published and labelled RNA-seq dataset (bulk or single-cell) can be
used as a reference, though its reliability depends greatly on the
expertise of the original authors who assigned the labels in the first
place.

In this section, we will demonstrate the use of the
`r Biocpkg("SingleR")` method for cell type annotation [Aran et al.,
2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0276-y). This method
assigns labels to cells based on the reference samples with the highest
Spearman rank correlations, using only the marker genes between pairs of
labels to focus on the relevant differences between cell types. It also
performs a fine-tuning step for each cell where the correlations are
recomputed with just the marker genes for the top-scoring labels. This
aims to resolve any ambiguity between those labels by removing noise
from irrelevant markers for other labels. Further details can be found
in the [*SingleR*
book](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/SingleRBook) from which
most of the examples here are derived.

::: callout

Remember, the quality of reference-based cell type annotation can only be as good as the cell type assignments in the reference. Garbage in, garbage out. In practice, it's worthwhile to spend time carefully assessing your to make sure the original assignments make sense and that it's compatible with the query dataset you're trying to annotate.

:::

Here we take a single sample from `EmbryoAtlasData` as our reference dataset. In practice you would want to take more/all samples, possibly with batch-effect correction (see the next episode).

```{r ref-data, message = FALSE}
ref <- EmbryoAtlasData(samples = 29)

ref
```

In order to reduce the computational load, we subsample the dataset to 1,000 cells.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

ind <- sample(ncol(ref), 1000)

ref <- ref[,ind]
```

You can see we have an assortment of different cell types in the reference (with varying frequency):

```{r ref-celltypes}
tab <- sort(table(ref$celltype), decreasing = TRUE)

tab
```

We need the normalized log counts, so we add those on: 

```{r ref-preproc}
ref <- logNormCounts(ref)
```

Some cleaning - remove cells of the reference dataset for which the cell
type annotation is missing:

```{r na-celltype}
nna <- !is.na(ref$celltype)

ref <- ref[,nna]
```

Also remove cell types of very low abundance (here less than 10 cells)
to remove noise prior to subsequent annotation tasks.

```{r low-abu-ct}
abu.ct <- names(tab)[tab >= 10]

ind <- ref$celltype %in% abu.ct

ref <- ref[,ind] 
```

Restrict to genes shared between query and reference dataset.

```{r shared-genes}
rownames(ref) <- rowData(ref)$SYMBOL

shared_genes <- intersect(rownames(sce), rownames(ref))

sce <- sce[shared_genes,]

ref <- ref[shared_genes,]
```

Convert sparse assay matrices to regular dense matrices for input to
SingleR:

```{r sparse-to-dense-mat}
sce.mat <- as.matrix(assay(sce, "logcounts"))

ref.mat <- as.matrix(assay(ref, "logcounts"))
```

Finally, run SingleR with the query and reference datasets:

```{r singler}
res <- SingleR(test = sce.mat, 
               ref = ref.mat,
               labels = ref$celltype)
res
```

We inspect the results using a heatmap of the per-cell and label scores.
Ideally, each cell should exhibit a high score in one label relative to
all of the others, indicating that the assignment to that label was
unambiguous. 

```{r score-heat, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
plotScoreHeatmap(res)
```

We obtained fairly unambiguous predictions for mesenchyme and endothelial
cells, whereas we see expectedly more ambiguity between the two
erythroid cell populations.

We can also compare the cell type assignments with the unsupervised clustering
results to determine the identity of each cluster. Here, several cell type
classes are nested within the same cluster, indicating that these clusters are
composed of several transcriptomically similar cell populations. On the other
hand, there are also instances where we have several clusters for the same cell
type, indicating that the clustering represents finer subdivisions within these
cell types.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
tab <- table(anno = res$pruned.labels, cluster = colLabels(sce))

pheatmap(log2(tab + 10), color = colorRampPalette(c("white", "blue"))(101))
```

As it so happens, we are in the fortunate position where our test
dataset also contains independently defined labels. We see strong
consistency between the two sets of labels, indicating that our
automatic annotation is comparable to that generated manually by domain
experts.

```{r anno-vs-preanno, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
tab <- table(res$pruned.labels, sce$celltype.mapped)

pheatmap(log2(tab + 10), color = colorRampPalette(c("white", "blue"))(101))
```

:::: challenge

Assign the SingleR annotations as a column in the colData for the query object `sce`.

::: solution

```{r}
sce$SingleR_label = res$pruned.labels
```

### Assigning cell labels from gene sets

A related strategy is to explicitly identify sets of marker genes that
are highly expressed in each individual cell. This does not require
matching of individual cells to the expression values of the reference
dataset, which is faster and more convenient when only the identities of
the markers are available. We demonstrate this approach using cell type
markers derived from the mouse embryo atlas dataset.

```{r atlas-markers}
wilcox.z <- pairwiseWilcox(ref, ref$celltype, lfc = 1, direction = "up")

markers.z <- getTopMarkers(wilcox.z$statistics, wilcox.z$pairs, 
                           pairwise = FALSE, n = 50)

lengths(markers.z)
```

<!--- 

This version with scoreMarkers() produces worse looking diagnostics, so let's leave it with the pairwise Wilcox version.
```{r atlas-markers-sM}

ref_markers <- scoreMarkers(ref, groups = ref$celltype, lfc = 1)

get_top_markers <- function(marker_df, n = 100) {
  ord <- order(marker_df$mean.AUC, decreasing = TRUE)
  
  rownames(marker_df[ord,])[1:n]
}

markers.z <- lapply(ref_markers, get_top_markers)

``` 

-->

Our test dataset will be as before the wild-type chimera dataset.

```{r wt-sce}
sce
```

We use the `r Biocpkg("AUCell")` package to identify marker sets that
are highly expressed in each cell. This method ranks genes by their
expression values within each cell and constructs a response curve of
the number of genes from each marker set that are present with
increasing rank. It then computes the area under the curve (AUC) for
each marker set, quantifying the enrichment of those markers among the
most highly expressed genes in that cell. This is roughly similar to
performing a Wilcoxon rank sum test between genes in and outside of the
set, but involving only the top ranking genes by expression in each
cell.

```{r create-gsets, message = FALSE}
all.sets <- lapply(names(markers.z), 
                   function(x) GeneSet(markers.z[[x]], setName = x))

all.sets <- GeneSetCollection(all.sets)

all.sets
```

```{r aucell}
rankings <- AUCell_buildRankings(as.matrix(counts(sce)),
                                 plotStats = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)

cell.aucs <- AUCell_calcAUC(all.sets, rankings)

results <- t(assay(cell.aucs))

head(results)
```

We assign cell type identity to each cell in the test dataset by taking
the marker set with the top AUC as the label for that cell. Our new
labels mostly agree with the original annotation (and, thus, also with
the reference-based annotation). Instances where the original annotation
is divided into several new label groups typically points to large
overlaps in their marker sets. In the absence of prior annotation, a
more general diagnostic check is to compare the assigned labels to
cluster identities, under the expectation that most cells of a single
cluster would have the same label (or, if multiple labels are present,
they should at least represent closely related cell states). We only print out the top-left corner of the table here, but you should try looking at the whole thing:

```{r anno-vs-cluster}
new.labels <- colnames(results)[max.col(results)]

tab <- table(new.labels, sce$celltype.mapped)

tab[1:4,1:4]
```

As a diagnostic measure, we examine the distribution of AUCs across
cells for each label. In heterogeneous populations, the distribution for
each label should be bimodal with one high-scoring peak containing cells
of that cell type and a low-scoring peak containing cells of other
types. The gap between these two peaks can be used to derive a threshold
for whether a label is "active" for a particular cell. (In this case, we
simply take the single highest-scoring label per cell as the labels
should be mutually exclusive.) In populations where a particular cell
type is expected, lack of clear bimodality for the corresponding label
may indicate that its gene set is not sufficiently informative.

```{r auc-dist, results="hide", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
par(mfrow = c(3,3))

AUCell_exploreThresholds(cell.aucs[1:9], plotHist = TRUE, assign = TRUE) 
```

Shown is the distribution of AUCs in the wild-type chimera dataset for
each label in the embryo atlas dataset. The blue curve represents the
density estimate, the red curve represents a fitted two-component
mixture of normals, the pink curve represents a fitted three-component
mixture, and the grey curve represents a fitted normal distribution.
Vertical lines represent threshold estimates corresponding to each
estimate of the distribution.

:::: challenge

Inspect the diagnostics for the next nine cell types. Do they look okay?

::: solution
```{r auc-dist2, results="hide", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
par(mfrow = c(3,3))

AUCell_exploreThresholds(cell.aucs[10:18], plotHist = TRUE, assign = TRUE)

## Exercises

::: challenge
#### Exercise 1: Clustering

The [Leiden
algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41695-z) is
similar to the Louvain algorithm, but it is faster and has been shown to
result in better connected communities. Modify the above call to
`clusterCells` to carry out the community detection with the Leiden
algorithm instead. Visualize the results in a UMAP plot.

::: hint
The `NNGraphParam` constructor has an argument `cluster.args`. This
allows to specify arguments passed on to the `cluster_leiden` function
from the
[igraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html)
package. Use the `cluster.args` argument to parameterize the clustering
to use modularity as the objective function and a resolution parameter
of 0.5.
:::

::: solution
```{r}
arg_list <- list(objective_function = "modularity",
                 resolution_parameter = .5)

sce$leiden_clust <- clusterCells(sce, use.dimred = "PCA",
                               BLUSPARAM = NNGraphParam(cluster.fun = "leiden", 
                                                        cluster.args = arg_list))

plotReducedDim(sce, "UMAP", color_by = "leiden_clust")
```

:::
:::

::: challenge
#### Exercise 2: Reference marker genes

Identify the marker genes in the reference single cell experiment, using the `celltype` labels that come with the dataset as the groups. Compare the top 100 marker genes of two cell types that are close in UMAP space. Do they share similar marker sets?

::: solution

```{r}
markers <- scoreMarkers(ref, groups = ref$celltype)

markers

# It comes with UMAP precomputed too
plotReducedDim(ref, dimred = "umap", color_by = "celltype") 

# Repetitive work -> write a function
order_marker_df <- function(m_df, n = 100) {
  
  ord <- order(m_df$mean.AUC, decreasing = TRUE)
  
  rownames(m_df[ord,][1:n,])
}

x <- order_marker_df(markers[["Erythroid2"]])

y <- order_marker_df(markers[["Erythroid3"]])

length(intersect(x,y)) / 100
```

Turns out there's pretty substantial overlap between `Erythroid2` and `Erythroid3`. It would also be interesting to plot the expression of the set difference to confirm that the remainder are the the genes used to distinguish these two types from each other.

:::
:::

:::: challenge 

#### Extension Challenge 1: Group pair comparisons

Why do you think marker genes are found by aggregating pairwise comparisons rather than iteratively comparing each cluster to all other clusters? 

::: solution

One important reason why is because averages over all other clusters can be sensitive to the cell type composition. If a rare cell type shows up in one sample, the most discriminative marker genes found in this way could be very different from those found in another sample where the rare cell type is absent. 

Generally, it's good to keep in mind that the concept of "everything else" is not a stable basis for comparison. Read that sentence again, because its a subtle but broadly applicable point. Think about it and you can probably identify analogous issues in fields outside of single-cell analysis. It frequently comes up when comparisons between multiple categories are involved.

#### Extension Challenge 2: Parallelizing SingleR

SingleR can be computationally expensive. How do you set it to run in parallel?

::: solution

Use `BiocParallel` and the `BPPARAM` argument! This example will set it to use four cores on your laptop, but you can also configure BiocParallel to use cluster jobs.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}

library(BiocParallel)

my_bpparam <- MulticoreParam(workers = 4)

res2 <- SingleR(test = sce.mat, 
                ref = ref.mat,
                labels = ref$celltype,
                BPPARAM = my_bpparam)
```

`BiocParallel` is the most common way to enable parallel computation in Bioconductor packages, so you can expect to see it elsewhere outside of SingleR.

:::

:::: challenge

#### Extension Challenge 3: Critical inspection of diagnostics

The first set of AUCell diagnostics don't look so good for some of the examples here. Which ones? Why?

::: solution

The example that jumps out most strongly to the eye is ExE endoderm, which doesn't show clear separate modes. Simultaneously, Endothelium seems to have three or four modes. 

Remember, this is an exploratory diagnostic, not the final word! At this point it'd be good to engage in some critical inspection of the results. Maybe we don't have enough / the best marker genes. In this particular case, the fact that we subsetted the reference set to 1000 cells probably didn't help.

::: keypoints
-   The two main approaches for cell type annotation are 1) manual annotation
    of clusters based on marker gene expression, and 2) computational annotation
    based on annotation transfer from reference datasets or marker gene set enrichment testing.
-   For manual annotation, cells are first clustered with unsupervised methods
    such as graph-based clustering followed by community detection algorithms such
    as Louvain or Leiden.
-   The `clusterCells` function from the `r Biocpkg("scran")` package provides different
    algorithms that are commonly used for the clustering of scRNA-seq data.
-   Once clusters have been obtained, cell type labels are then manually
    assigned to cell clusters by matching cluster-specific upregulated marker
    genes with prior knowledge of cell-type markers.
-   The `scoreMarkers` function from the `r Biocpkg("scran")` package 
    package can be used to find candidate marker genes for clusters of cells by
    ranking differential expression between pairs of clusters.
-   Computational annotation using published reference datasets or curated gene sets
    provides a fast, automated, and reproducible alternative to the manual
    annotation of cell clusters based on marker gene expression.
-   The `r Biocpkg("SingleR")`
    package is a popular choice for reference-based annotation and assigns labels
    to cells based on the reference samples with the highest Spearman rank correlations.
-   The `r Biocpkg("AUCell")` package provides an enrichment
    test to identify curated marker sets that are highly expressed in each cell.
