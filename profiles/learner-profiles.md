title: Learner profiles
---

This course is aimed at graduate students, postdocs, and faculty interested in learning about single cell analysis in the Bioconductor ecosystem in R. Learners should have a solid basis in the following foundational areas:

* Molecular biology basics on concepts such as DNA sequencing, cell structure, and the central dogma of molecular biology
* Statistics basics such as hypothesis tests, summary statistics, principal component analysis
* R basics such as variable assignment, accessing object components, and looking up help documentation

The following online textbooks/resources provide excellent coverage of these and related topics if you would like a refresher:

* *Molecular Biology of the Cell*, Alberts et al.
* [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/)
* Bioconductor Carpentries on [Introduction to data analysis with R](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-intro/) and [RNA-seq analysis](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-rnaseq/)
* [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

The following are *not* required:

* your own single-cell dataset (we use publicly available data)
* access to high-performance computing environments (we use small demonstrative examples that are tractable on any reasonably modern laptop)
